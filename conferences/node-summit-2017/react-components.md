# Reusability w/ React Components

Walmart, ASDA, Sam's Club
    Theming?

All components are outside the application. Own repos
    All components need to have all the same tools

Archetypes = component templates

New archetype per ART project?

Ambassadors from other teams come together to discuss managing components. Better than isolated spike team?

Github proposal process
- Direction or change, component. API/details. Reasoning
    Encourages discussion across teams

Discovery process
- Electrode explorer. Runs all components
    Dependent on archetype

Sub-archetypes?

Updates breaking other breaks
    Solved by CICD - critical piece
        Auto-runs other apps' tests

## Ecosystem of reuse
Affects absolutely everything. Must be org committment
