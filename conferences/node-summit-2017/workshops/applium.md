WebDriver - HTTP API

Appium -> WEbdriver Shim

Bet benefits of new automation tech without having to rewrite tests
Leverage industry-standard Selenium/WebDriver experience.
Use the newest automated technologies for your tests
Write cross-platform tests: one API for multiple platforms
Encourage platform vendors to support one stable and stadnard protocol

Hopefully moving towards industry automated testing standards
