# TypeScript

Slack ported to TypeScript

- JSDoc/ESDoc requires trust in devs
- Vanilla JS requires source code study
Both methods are inefficient, frustrating, and failure-prone

TypeScript:
- Superset of JS
- No modification of code at runtime
- Excellent editor support
- Excellent integration with the npm world
- Types!
- Major: Prevents runtime issues
- Autocomplete

Just change to .ts file
TS can peek at function definition, give available methods
Transpiling is lightweight

`npm install @types/request`

Committing with confidence

Interfaces, type declarations, and enums.
