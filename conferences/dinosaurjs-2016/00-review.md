## What where the main takeaways or key lessons from each session/workshop you attended?

### JavaScript As Play

Making games is not terribly difficult with all the libraries out there these days.


### What Ever Happened to Those Dinosaurs?

d3.js is a very powerful library for data-visualization and it's fairly easy to set up a graph/chart/visual. The greatest benefit to using it is scaling, a result of using SVG instead of Canvas


### Getting Started with WebGL

WebGL is complex, but it can leverage the user's GPU to help process data in parallel (as opposed to using a browser's single thread). A practical use for WebGL is maps and graphing.


### Doing the Unstuck: How to Make Browsers Compatible with Web JavaScript

There are people employed by browser companies to review developers' code and to reverse engineer features of other browsers so that it can be documented and implemented in their own. 
Developers should read web standards/specs, test, use pre-release browsers, and report bugs.


### Making it Better Without Making it Over

Codebase growth can't be avoided, it's complexity has to managed. "Growth is not bad, growth without a strategy for managing it is"
"Every technology decision is eventually regretable" made in good faith with best information they had at the time
"Its unrealistic for you ... to learn a framework that solves a problem you've never experienced"
Education is a powerful enabler. It's easier to teach someone how to use a framework than to teach the fundamental problem solving skills, but teaching how to care and what to care about is immensely transformative.


### Age of the JavaScript-Powered Desktop

Electron is a combination of tools (Node.js + Chromium) that lets you build a desktop application using modern web technology. Electron replces background processes w/ Node.js so multiple processes can be run simultaneously (limitation of current browsers). The desktop is still where real work is getting done.


### Server Farm to Table (or, How the Internet Works)

There are many ways to optimize front-end code to leverage the current protocols, but with the arrival of HTTP 2.0, many of them will be obsolete. If using CSS animations, learning how the browser paint process works is immensely valuable.


### Single Page Access: The Road to Using Our Power for Good

Our work should be a positive impact on people's lives, but we don't always reach everyone. Incorporate a11y testing in your test suite. Recommends that the build breaks if accessibility breaks


### IoT Prototyping with Firebase and JavaScript

There are JavaScript libraries available to interface your code with lower-level processes/code, which allow for control over hardware. Raspberry Pi may be more accessible than Arduino.


## How will you apply what you learned at this event to projects you are currently working on?

I'll be looking more into d3.js for visualization of data and experimenting with the dozens of different types of graphs available. I'm going to look into our project's optimization techniques and see how we can best prepare for HTTP2. I'm going to ensure our project has the minimum accessibility concerns addressed and I am going to re-assess the organization of the project to help steer future growth into a manageable state.


## Did you see any technology that you think Kenzan should implement or adopt? Please explain.

I think desktop applications using Electron has a lot of potential and I'm looking for excuses to dive in. I believe it will enable seamless productivity across platforms on focused internal projects. We should definitely be doing accessibility audits (for external projects at a minimum) to make a positive impact on our clients' users. I'd like Kenzan to take stock in it's greener developers and teach how to care and what to care about when developing; to develop those troubleshooting skills which make up half of the job.


## What topic will your blog post be about? Please provide a brief description.

Refactoring large/old codebases would make for an interesting blog post, as a lot of effort and money has been put into them over time. We don't always have the luxury of starting projects from scratch, but we can learn from past mistakes to come up with a plan going forward.


## Please put in a tentative date for a draft of your blog post (must be within 3 weeks of the conference)

July 14th


## Would you attend this event again next year?

Yes, if they address the issues I had:

- No WiFi
- Things on stage (including the presenter) were blocking the screen
- Screen brightness was too low, hard to read in a dark room
