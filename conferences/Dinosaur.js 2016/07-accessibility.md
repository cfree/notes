## Ways to connect to a TV

- AppleTV?
- Chromecast 2 - Chromium-backed web apps
	Requires registered app
- Some limitations: Must be using a Chrome browser or Google Cast extension
- Amazon FireTV HTML5 support
- Raspberry Pi 3 - low-power, lightweight
- Computer


## Way to interact with a TV

- WebSockets
- mDNS (zeroconf, Bonjour): local network discovery
	Discovery of nearby FlyWeb services
- DIAL: protocol used by SmartTVs, Chromecast, etc.
- WebRTC: Low-latency (encrypted P2P), handshake needed
	Requires third-party to discover (server)
	Super-responsive UI


## Why bother?
