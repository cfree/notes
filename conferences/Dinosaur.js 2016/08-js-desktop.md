1. Node Webkit (nw.js) - Chromium-based frame
1. Atom shell
1. Electron - lets you build an app using modern web technology, drop in dock, run


Electron = Chromium + Node.js


Chromium has C++ background process spawns renderers (tabs)

Electron replaces background process w/ Node.js

1. "Native" experience
	1. Right-click menu
	1. Notifications
	1. Controls in toolbar
	1. No cross-browser styling concerns
	1. Retina detail
1. Process control
	1. Electron rebuild
	1. Node GYP
	1. Windows
1. Performance
	1. Dev Tools
	1. Spawn processes (service-worker) with interface/UI in worker windows
1. Storage & offline
	1. localStorage, SQLite
	1. Reactive.js (Observables)
1. Extensibility
	1. Supports plugins


Nylas/n1 open source Electron-based email app

Recommends referring to the Electron docs and quick-start


## Why does this matter?

"Desktop is still where real work is getting done"


Top Electron apps: Visual Studio Code, Atom editor

"The native feel is 'the fold' of our generation"
