# Wonderful WordPress Workflows

Love your process. Everyone needs to be on board. Every team works differently.

Process for everything
- tasks, bugs
- Where, how development is done
- QA
- Deployments
- Ongoing maintenance

- Code should not be owned by the person who wrote it
	- Consistency is key
	- Use a style guide
	- Document everything

"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live" - Martin Golding

Plugins
- Curated list of pre-approved plugins for your team to refer to when in need of special functionality
- Build your own plugins for internal use
- Leave plugins outside of repo

QA
- Requires fresh eyes
- Checklists make life easier
- Identify common problem areas with previous projects and make sure to check them moving forward
- Decide on browser support before starting a project

Boilerplate

Internal plugins
- micro-plugins
- adds functionality without bloat
- more control over codebase
- allows you to globaly udate code on all websites
- Tools to help manage: 
	- TGM plugin activation
	- GitHub updater

Automation
- Automating mundane tasks
- Gulp, Grunt

Keep sites up to date (audit?)

Things change at scale
